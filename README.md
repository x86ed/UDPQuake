- `isort` - Import sorter
- `mypy` - Type checker

### 5. Verify Installation

Run the comprehensive unit tests to ensure everything is working:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

You should see all tests pass in under a second.

### 6. Configure the Service

UDPQuake uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to configure your setup:

```bash
# USGS Earthquake Service Configuration
USGS_HOST=earthquake.usgs.gov
EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LATITUDE=33.0
EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LONGITUDE=-120.0
EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LATITUDE=35.0
EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LONGITUDE=-116.0

# Optional: Override default coordinate bounds for your region
# Example for Southern California (default values shown above)
# For Northern California, you might use:
# EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LATITUDE=36.0
# EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LONGITUDE=-124.0
# EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LATITUDE=42.0
# EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LONGITUDE=-119.0
```

**Available Environment Variables:**

- `USGS_HOST` - USGS API hostname (default: `earthquake.usgs.gov`)
- `EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LATITUDE` - Southern boundary (default: `33.0`)
- `EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LONGITUDE` - Western boundary (default: `-120.0`)
- `EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LATITUDE` - Northern boundary (default: `35.0`)
- `EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LONGITUDE` - Eastern boundary (default: `-116.0`)

### 7. Test the Service

Run the service manually to test:

```bash
python -m udpquake
```

### 8. Install as System Service (First-Time Setup)

To run UDPQuake automatically as a background service that starts on boot, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Determine Your Paths

First, note your current username and the full path to your UDPQuake installation:

```bash
# Check your username
whoami

# Get the full path to your UDPQuake directory
pwd
```

#### Step 2: Create the Service File

Create a systemd service file with elevated privileges:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/udpquake.service
```

#### Step 3: Configure the Service

Add the following content to the service file, **replacing the paths and username** with your actual values:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=UDPQuake Seismic Monitor
After=network-online.target ssh.service
Wants=network-online.target
Requires=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=YOUR_USERNAME
WorkingDirectory=/full/path/to/UDPQuake
ExecStart=/full/path/to/UDPQuake/.venv/bin/python -m udpquake
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
TimeoutStartSec=60
TimeoutStopSec=30
Environment=PATH=/full/path/to/UDPQuake/.venv/bin
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

# Resource limits to prevent system issues
LimitNOFILE=1024
MemoryMax=256M
CPUQuota=50%

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Example for Raspberry Pi (typical setup):**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=UDPQuake Seismic Monitor
After=network-online.target ssh.service
Wants=network-online.target
Requires=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/UDPQuake
ExecStart=/home/pi/UDPQuake/.venv/bin/python -m udpquake
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
TimeoutStartSec=60
TimeoutStopSec=30
Environment=PATH=/home/pi/UDPQuake/.venv/bin
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

# Resource limits to prevent system issues
LimitNOFILE=1024
MemoryMax=256M
CPUQuota=50%

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Step 4: Enable and Start the Service

After saving the service file, run these commands to install and start the service:

```bash
# Reload systemd to recognize the new service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable the service to start automatically on boot
sudo systemctl enable udpquake

# Start the service immediately
sudo systemctl start udpquake

# Check that the service started successfully
sudo systemctl status udpquake
```

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

Confirm the service is running properly:

```bash
# Check service status (should show "active (running)")
sudo systemctl status udpquake

# View recent logs to ensure it's working
sudo journalctl -u udpquake -n 20

# Follow logs in real-time (press Ctrl+C to stop)
sudo journalctl -u udpquake -f
```

If everything is working correctly, you should see log messages indicating the service has started and is monitoring for earthquakes.

## Configuration

UDPQuake is configured using environment variables defined in a `.env` file. Here are the available configuration options:

### USGS Service Configuration

- **USGS_HOST**: USGS API hostname (default: `earthquake.usgs.gov`)
- **EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LATITUDE**: Southern boundary for earthquake queries (default: `33.0`)
- **EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LONGITUDE**: Western boundary for earthquake queries (default: `-120.0`)
- **EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LATITUDE**: Northern boundary for earthquake queries (default: `35.0`)
- **EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LONGITUDE**: Eastern boundary for earthquake queries (default: `-116.0`)

### Regional Configuration Examples

**Southern California (default):**

```bash
EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LATITUDE=33.0
EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LONGITUDE=-120.0
EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LATITUDE=35.0
EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LONGITUDE=-116.0
```

**Northern California:**

```bash
EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LATITUDE=36.0
EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LONGITUDE=-124.0
EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LATITUDE=42.0
EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LONGITUDE=-119.0
```

**Pacific Northwest:**

```bash
EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LATITUDE=42.0
EARTHQUAKE_MIN_LONGITUDE=-125.0
EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LATITUDE=49.0
EARTHQUAKE_MAX_LONGITUDE=-116.0
```

## Usage

Once installed and configured, UDPQuake runs automatically as a background service. It will:

1. Poll the USGS earthquake feed at configured intervals
2. Filter earthquakes based on magnitude and distance
3. Format earthquake data for mesh transmission
4. Send UDP packets to connected Meshtastic devices
5. Log all activities for monitoring

### Manual Control

```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl start udpquake

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop udpquake

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status udpquake

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u udpquake -f
```

## Message Format

Earthquake alerts sent to the mesh include:

```sh
üö® EARTHQUAKE ALERT
Magnitude: 4.2
Location: 15km SW of San Francisco, CA
Depth: 8.3km
Time: 2024-01-15 14:30:22 UTC
Distance from node: 23km
```

## Monitoring and Logs

- Service logs: `sudo journalctl -u udpquake`
- Application logs: `/var/log/udpquake.log` (if configured)
- Status monitoring: `sudo systemctl status udpquake`

## Troubleshooting

### Service Setup Issues

If you're having trouble setting up the systemd service for the first time, try these steps:

1. **Service fails to start**
   - Verify all paths in the service file are correct and absolute
   - Check that the user specified has permissions to access the UDPQuake directory
   - Ensure the virtual environment exists: `ls -la /path/to/UDPQuake/.venv/bin/python`
   - Test the command manually: `/path/to/UDPQuake/.venv/bin/python -m udpquake`

2. **Permission denied errors**
   ```bash
   # Make sure the service file has correct permissions
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/udpquake.service
   
   # Reload systemd after fixing permissions
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

3. **Service file syntax errors**
   ```bash
   # Check for syntax issues in the service file
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl status udpquake
   ```

4. **Environment variables not loading**
   - Ensure your `.env` file is in the WorkingDirectory specified in the service file
   - Check file permissions: `ls -la /path/to/UDPQuake/.env`
   - The service user must have read access to the `.env` file

5. **Check service logs for detailed errors**
   ```bash
   # View full service logs
   sudo journalctl -u udpquake --no-pager
   
   # View only error messages
   sudo journalctl -u udpquake -p err
   ```

### Common Issues

1. **No earthquake data received**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify USGS feed URL is accessible
   - Review filter settings (magnitude/distance thresholds)

2. **Meshtastic not receiving messages**
   - Verify UDP host/port configuration
   - Check network connectivity to Meshtastic device
   - Ensure Meshtastic device is in correct mode

3. **SSH access blocked after starting UDPQuake service**

   **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: UDPQuake uses UDP multicast on `224.0.0.69:4403`, which should not interfere with SSH (port 22). This issue is likely caused by network configuration or resource conflicts.

   **Immediate Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the UDPQuake service immediately to restore SSH access
   sudo systemctl stop udpquake
   
   # Disable automatic startup until the issue is resolved
   sudo systemctl disable udpquake
   ```

   **Root Cause Analysis:**
   ```bash
   # Verify UDPQuake is not using port 22 (it shouldn't be)
   sudo netstat -tuln | grep :22
   sudo netstat -tuln | grep :4403
   
   # Check what processes are listening on network ports
   sudo ss -tulpn | grep :22
   sudo ss -tulpn | grep :4403
   
   # Verify SSH daemon is running
   sudo systemctl status ssh
   ```

   **Potential Solutions:**

   a) **Network Interface Timing Issues** - UDPQuake might start before network is fully ready:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/udpquake.service
   ```
   Update the `[Unit]` section:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=UDPQuake Seismic Monitor
   After=network-online.target ssh.service
   Wants=network-online.target
   Requires=network-online.target
   ```

   b) **Resource Exhaustion** - Check if UDPQuake is consuming too many system resources:
   ```bash
   # Monitor resource usage
   sudo systemctl start udpquake
   top -p $(pgrep -f udpquake)
   free -h
   
   # Check file descriptor usage
   sudo lsof -p $(pgrep -f udpquake) | wc -l
   ```

   c) **Enhanced Service Configuration** - Use resource limits to prevent system exhaustion:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/udpquake.service
   ```
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=UDPQuake Seismic Monitor
   After=network-online.target ssh.service
   Wants=network-online.target
   Requires=network-online.target
   
   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=pi
   WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/UDPQuake
   ExecStart=/home/pi/UDPQuake/.venv/bin/python -m udpquake
   Restart=on-failure
   RestartSec=30
   TimeoutStartSec=60
   TimeoutStopSec=30
   Environment=PATH=/home/pi/UDPQuake/.venv/bin
   StandardOutput=journal
   StandardError=journal
   
   # Resource limits to prevent system exhaustion
   LimitNOFILE=1024
   MemoryMax=256M
   CPUQuota=50%
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   **Safe Testing Approach:**
   ```bash
   # Always test with console/physical access available
   # 1. Start service manually
   sudo systemctl start udpquake
   
   # 2. Test SSH access from another terminal
   ssh user@your-pi-ip
   
   # 3. Monitor logs for issues
   sudo journalctl -u udpquake -f
   
   # 4. If SSH fails, use console to stop service
   sudo systemctl stop udpquake
   ```

3. **Service won't start**
   - Check Python dependencies: `uv pip list`
   - Verify environment variables in `.env` file
   - Review systemd service file permissions

### Debug Mode

For debugging, you can run the service directly to see console output:

```bash
python -m udpquake
```

Or check the systemd service logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u udpquake -f
```
